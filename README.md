# Autonomous-Driving - SLAM

  This project is a part of # SLAM and # Path Planning course given by the professor Claus Brenner from the University of Leibniz. The course is based on the data (LiDAR and Encoder) collected from a lego based robot with caterpillar tracks navigated through a controlled environment. 
  
  Unit A - Developing a motion model, finding the trajectory from the encoder data and identifying landmarks from LiDAR data.
